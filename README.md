## 1. Overview  
This narrative mini‑campaign lets 3–6 players each command a Federation **frigate** patrolling the Romulan Neutral Zone for Sixth Fleet.  
* Era: **Y159–Y165** (post‑Smarba, pre‑Hawk)  
* Goal: Uncover and blunt an impending Romulan invasion.  
* Play style: Classic **Captain’s Game** carry‑over—damage, ammo, crew, and prestige persist between scenarios.  
* Meta‑dial: A public **Tension Score (TS)** tracks how seriously Star Fleet takes the threat; high TS brings reinforcements, low TS means the invasion arrives as a surprise.

## 8. Ready‑Room Player Briefing (hand‑out)  

> *“You’re Patrol Group Delta‑Three, a line of Federation frigates on the Romulan border. Starbase 10 writes your pay‑checks, Admiral Fernández wants answers, and the Empire just bolted Klingon engines onto their War Eagles. Keep the peace, gather intel, and if you bring home the proof, maybe HQ will believe you before the firebirds come screaming across the Zone.”*

---

### Print & Play  
*Designed for face‑to‑face or VASSAL play.  Average CGP haul 8–12 per scenario; promotions assume 8‑scenario arc but scale smoothly for shorter campaigns.*  
Good luck, Captain—watch the plasma and mind the Tension Score!
